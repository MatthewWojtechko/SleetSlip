Code for a game made for educational demonstration.

When I was asked to give a virtual presentation to a class of high school game design students, I decided the most worthwhile thing I could do was create a small game and step through the gist of my process.
I based my game off an existing demo of a type of game the students could make in the class.
I retained its main conceit of a penguin dodging falling icicles via mouse control, but I gave it a total makeover in the game design, look, feel, and sound.
In addition to creating a fun bite-sized game, I offered first-hand insight into the ups and downs of game development through my presentation. I would say this project was a success!
